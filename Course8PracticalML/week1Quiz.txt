Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

We may be using a bad algorithm that doesn't predict well on this kind of data.

-->Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

We have too few predictors to get good out of sample accuracy.

We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance.

What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

-->60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.

10% test set, 90% training set

50% training set, 50% test set

90% training set, 10% test set

What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)? Check the correct answer(s).

R^2

Median absolute deviation

Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

50%

99%

-->9%

99.9%
