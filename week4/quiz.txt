1。
What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?



1
2
set.seed(1)
rpois(5, 2)

It is impossible to tell because the result is random

A vector with the numbers 3.3, 2.5, 0.5, 1.1, 1.7

A vector with the numbers 1, 4, 1, 1, 5

A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1
正確 
Because the `set.seed()' function is used, `rpois()' will always output the same vector in this code.

2。
What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?

pnorm

dnorm

qnorm

rnorm

3。
When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important? Select all that apply.

It ensures that the random numbers generated are within specified boundaries.
這個選項的答案不正確 

It can be used to generate non-uniform random numbers.
這個選項的答案不正確 

It ensures that the sequence of random numbers is truly random.
這個選項的答案不正確 

It can be used to specify which random number generating algorithm R should use, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

8。
Consider the following R code



1
2
3
4
library(datasets)
Rprof()
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
Rprof(NULL)
(Assume that y, x1, and x2 are present in the workspace.) Without running the code, what percentage of the run time is spent in the 'lm' function, based on the 'by.total' method of normalization shown in 'summaryRprof()'?

It is not possible to tell

23%

50%

100%
正確 
When using `by.total' normalization, the top-level function (in this case, `lm()') always takes 100% of the time.

正確

9。
When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?

It is the time spent by the CPU waiting for other tasks to finish

It is the "wall-clock" time it takes to evaluate an expression

It is a measure of network latency

It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression

10。
If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following is true when using 'system.time()'?

elapsed time may be smaller than user time
正確 

elapsed time is 0

user time is always smaller than elapsed time

user time is 0
